## üì± Hero Section

### Current Content (Hero.tsx):
```
Badge: "Carfolio Waitlist"
Headline: "Get Early Access to Your Car's Digital Home"
Description: "CarFolio helps automotive enthusiasts create stunning digital showcases for their vehicles, share them with a single link, and even earn money from their passion."
CTA: [Waitlist Form]
Footer: "No credit card required. Lock in founder pricing for life."
```

### New Content:

## üîÑ Problem ‚Üí BeforeAfter Transformation

### Current Content (Problem.tsx):
```
Title: "The Problem We're Solving"
Content: "As car enthusiasts ourselves, we know the frustration:"

Problems List:
- Social media buries your best build photos in your feed
- Forums limit your ability to showcase multiple cars  
- There's no easy way to share your complete build history
- You spend time recommending parts but earn nothing from it

Conclusion: "CarFolio is the solution car enthusiasts have been waiting for."
```

### New Content (BeforeAfter.tsx):
```
Title: "Your Build is Epic. Your Showcase Should Be, Too."

Section 1: "From a Buried Feed to a Pro Showcase"
"Let's be real: social media wasn't built for car enthusiasts. Your best build photos get buried after a day, and there's no clean way to document your journey. CarFolio gives your vehicles the stunning, permanent home they deserve. Create dedicated portfolios for each car, with media galleries you actually control."

Section 2: "From a Texted List to a Single Link"
"Tired of repeating your mod list in DMs and forum comments? We were too. CarFolio gives you one simple, shareable link (carfolio.io/yourusername) for your entire garage. It's the only link you'll ever need for your build, period."

Section 3: "From a Hobby Expense to a Paying Passion"
"You already recommend parts and products to other enthusiasts. It's time you got rewarded for it. With CarFolio, you can easily add affiliate links to your build list. Turn your passion project into a paycheck and let your car start paying for itself."
```

**Key Changes:**
- Narrative "Before ‚Üí After" structure
- More conversational, relatable tone ("Let's be real", "We were too")
- Benefit-focused rather than problem-focused
- Solution integrated into each problem

## ‚ùì FAQ Streamlining

### Current Content (FAQ.tsx):
```
[Multiple questions - needs analysis to see full list]
```

### New Content (FAQ.tsx):
```
Streamlined to 4 Essential Questions:

1. "Is the price really locked in forever?"
   "Yes. Whatever founder rate you secure when your spot on the waitlist unlocks is yours for life, as long as you maintain your subscription."

2. "When will CarFolio officially launch?"  
   "We are currently in private beta and are planning our public launch for 2025. Waitlist members will get access first."

3. "How do the affiliate earnings work?"
   "You can add your own affiliate links from any network (like Amazon Associates, etc.) to the parts on your build list. When someone clicks and buys, the commission goes directly to you."

4. "Is a credit card required to join the waitlist?"
   "Absolutely not. You'll only need to enter payment details when your spot unlocks and you decide to activate your account."
```

**Key Changes:**
- Reduced to only conversion-critical questions
- Addresses main hesitations (cost, timeline, earnings, commitment)
- Removes unnecessary complexity
